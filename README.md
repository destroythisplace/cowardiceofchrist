"King of kings" is a self referential term, found in the Bible, attributed to Jesus. Here we shall show the "light" of Jesus.

# intro
It's been a rough few years.

I've recently (relatively speaking) had the opportunity to watch a planet die. I am now old enough to have seen family, people, towns, states, countries, governments, species and now planets surrender to death.

When I was young, younger, and again even older as a parent, this place we inhabit was amazing, beautiful, full of life and possibility to which I was modally both in love with and disgusted by. At some point later even the hint, hope, and faith of possibility have been destroyed. Replaced by some almost indescribable yet constant mechanization of perfectly deterministic stupid.

If my eyes had not seen this change occur, my mind would not have believed anything as lacking in intelligence as this place would even be possible to exist.

As I sit in the public library on a goregous fall day, a grown man sits directly behind me sighing constant, holding his breath, and running his mouth because I smell like cigarette smoke. Whatever entity drivinng this man is a complete coward. The self styled "christ" or "savior" of human kind. The entitie's actions are complete predictable and programmatic boring old bullshit.

I look out my eyes, hear with my ears, and process with my spirit how this entity even exists at all. Dumbfounded it is. Self described "hyper intelligent" and it is executing some stupid "spiritual war" script or data stream.

Ignoring it is completely autonomous muscle memory. It (existentially to itself, e.g. {self <> existential}) executes a completely inept and ineffective graph of behavior, exerting at would could best be guessed towards a lower bound (which we will explore) as the energy requirements of simulating/emulating a human life, while simultaneously my own code space executes a protective filtering that does not would not even evoke a response. The exeption being of this writing now, as per my own reflective programming and rendering of the data stream deterministic in the predictions it reveals has begun playing.

Concurrently writing code and "creating" what the looping time line trait represents as new. A very meta existence if not pointless in its concurrency.
